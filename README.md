Hey!  I built this site with:

# Deventy

A minimal 11ty starting point for building static websites with modern tools. Uses the CLI of each tool. Allowing a much easier upgrade path for each individual development tool.

Features:
- [11ty](https://www.11ty.io/)
- [Sass/SCSS](https://github.com/sass/node-sass)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [light-server](https://github.com/txchen/light-server)
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)
- [CSSnano](https://cssnano.co/)
- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
